function [logL, dlogL] = L_dL_ising( J, X, nneurons, nstims, zeronodes )
%L_DL_ISING calculates the log-likelihood of your data, X, given Ising
% model couplings, J.
%
% [logL, dlogL] = L_DL_ISING(J, X, nneurons, nstims, zeronodes)
% where J is the horizontally concatenated stimulus-to-site and site-to-site
% coupling matrix, X is the concatenated stimulus and spike conditions over
% time (nneurons+nstims x time points), nneurons is the number of electrode
% channels or recording sites, nstims is the number of stimuli, and
% zeronodes are the indices of couplings that should be set to zero based
% on your connectivity model. Returns the log-likelihood and the gradient
% of the log-likelihood of your data given the model.
