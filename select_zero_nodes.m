function [Jnew_all, zeronodes, modelname] = select_zero_nodes(model, Js, Jn)
%SELECT_ZERO_NODES(model, Js, Jn) 
% sets values of the stimulus-to-site coupling matrices Js and the 
% site-to-site coupling matrices Jn to be zero given a particular 
% hypothesis about the connectivity matrix. 
%
%    [Jnew_all, zeronodes, modelname] = SELECT_ZERO_NODES(model, Js, Jn)
%    where model is a number between 0 and 7, Js is the n x s stimulus-to-site
%    coupling matrix, and Jn is the n x n site-to-site coupling matrix.  Returns
%    the zeroed Jnew_all coupling matrix (concatenated new Js and Jn) as well 
%    as zeronodes, which are the numbers of the nodes that should not be updated 
%    when calculating the derivative of the objective function in K_dK_ising_L1reg.m.
%
%    IMPORTANT: This code assumes a 4 x 4 electrode grid or polytrode configuration.
%    If you are using something different, you will need to write your own function.
%    Setting model = 0 (fully connected model) will work for any configuration, since
%    zeronodes is just an empty set.
