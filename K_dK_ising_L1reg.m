function [K, dK] = K_dK_ising_L1reg( J, X, nneurons, nstims, lambda, zeronodes)
%K_DK_ISING_L1REG Fits the minimum probability flow learning objective
% function for an Ising model fit to neural data with the connectivity
% matrix of your choice. 
%
%  [K, dK] = K_DK_ISING_L1REG(J, X, nneurons, nstims, lambda, zeronodes), 
%  where J is the horizontally concatenated stimulus-to-site and site-to-site
%  coupling matrix, X is the concatenated stimulus and spike conditions over
%  time (nneurons+nstims x time points), nneurons is the number of electrode
%  channels or recording sites, nstims is the number of stimuli, lambda is 
%  the L1 regularization parameter, and zeronodes are the indices of couplings
%  that should be set to zero based on your connectivity model.
%  Returns the MPF objective function value K and the gradient of the function,
%  dK.  This function is minimized using 3rd party code minFunc by Mark Schmidt
%  (see details in ising_neurons_L1reg.m)

% This code is written under the greatly accelerating assumption that 
% samples in the data vector differ from each other by more than one 
% bit flip (see http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4779). This is nearly always 
% true for large systems, but means you'll get funny answers if you do
% a test run with a system of only a few units with lots of data.
